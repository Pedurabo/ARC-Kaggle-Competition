# ARC Prize 2025 - Competition Rules Strategy

## üìã **Critical Competition Rules**

### üéØ **Submission Strategy**
- **Daily Limit**: 1 submission per day
- **Final Submissions**: 2 submissions for final judging
- **Timeline**: Entry deadline October 27, 2025; Final submission November 3, 2025

### üë• **Team Strategy**
- **Maximum Team Size**: 5 members
- **Team Mergers**: Allowed until merger deadline
- **Code Sharing**: Private sharing only within teams

### üìä **Evaluation Strategy**
- **Public Leaderboard**: Based on 50% of test data
- **Private Leaderboard**: Based on other 50% (final ranking)
- **Scoring**: Percentage of correct predictions with 2 attempts per task

## üöÄ **Optimized Strategy Based on Rules**

### 1. **Submission Management**

#### Daily Submission Strategy
```bash
# Day 1: Test baseline performance
python src/main.py --model baseline --output submission_baseline.json

# Day 2: Test pattern matching
python src/main.py --model pattern_matching --output submission_pattern.json

# Day 3: Test symbolic reasoning
python src/main.py --model symbolic --output submission_symbolic.json

# Day 4: Test ensemble approach
python src/main.py --model ensemble --output submission_ensemble.json

# Day 5: Test few-shot learning
python src/main.py --model few_shot --output submission_fewshot.json
```

#### Final Submission Strategy
- **Submission 1**: Best performing model (likely ensemble)
- **Submission 2**: Alternative approach (symbolic or few-shot)

### 2. **Team Optimization**

#### Recommended Team Structure (5 members max)
1. **Lead Researcher**: Overall strategy and novel approaches
2. **ML Engineer**: Model implementation and optimization
3. **Data Scientist**: Pattern analysis and feature engineering
4. **Software Engineer**: Code quality and submission pipeline
5. **Domain Expert**: ARC problem understanding and validation

#### Team Collaboration Guidelines
- **Private Code Sharing**: Only within team
- **Public Sharing**: Use Kaggle forums for open discussions
- **Version Control**: Maintain clean, reproducible code
- **Documentation**: Prepare for open source requirement

### 3. **External Resources Strategy**

#### Allowed External Data/Tools
- **Open Source Models**: Hugging Face, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Public Datasets**: ImageNet, CIFAR, etc. (if relevant)
- **Free APIs**: Reasonable cost thresholds apply
- **Academic Papers**: Public research is fair game

#### Cost Considerations
- **Reasonable Threshold**: Shouldn't exceed prize value
- **Accessibility**: Must be available to all participants
- **Documentation**: Must document all external resources used

### 4. **Open Source Preparation**

#### Code Quality Requirements
```python
# Example: Well-documented model class
class CompetitionModel(BaseARCModel):
    """
    ARC Prize 2025 Competition Model
    
    This model implements a novel reasoning approach combining:
    - Symbolic reasoning for logical transformations
    - Neural embeddings for pattern recognition
    - Ensemble methods for robustness
    
    Requirements:
    - Python 3.8+
    - Dependencies: requirements.txt
    - Data: ARC-AGI-2 dataset
    
    Usage:
        model = CompetitionModel()
        predictions = model.solve_task(task)
    """
    
    def __init__(self, config=None):
        """Initialize the model with configuration."""
        super().__init__(config)
        # Implementation details...
    
    def solve_task(self, task):
        """Solve ARC task using novel reasoning approach."""
        # Implementation details...
```

#### Documentation Requirements
- **README.md**: Complete setup and usage instructions
- **requirements.txt**: All dependencies with versions
- **configs/**: Configuration files for reproducibility
- **tests/**: Unit tests for validation
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation

### 5. **Timeline Optimization**

#### Pre-Entry Phase (Now - October 27)
- [ ] **Week 1-2**: Implement and test all basic models
- [ ] **Week 3-4**: Develop advanced approaches
- [ ] **Week 5-6**: Optimize and validate
- [ ] **Week 7**: Final preparation and entry

#### Competition Phase (October 27 - November 3)
- [ ] **Day 1**: Submit baseline to establish position
- [ ] **Day 2-5**: Submit different approaches
- [ ] **Day 6-7**: Optimize based on leaderboard feedback
- [ ] **Final Day**: Submit best two approaches

### 6. **Risk Management**

#### Common Disqualification Risks
1. **Multiple Accounts**: Use only one Kaggle account
2. **Private Code Sharing**: Only share within team
3. **External Data Costs**: Keep costs reasonable
4. **Open Source Compliance**: Ensure all code is properly licensed

#### Mitigation Strategies
- **Code Review**: Regular team code reviews
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing before submission
- **Backup Plans**: Multiple approaches ready

## üéØ **Implementation Plan**

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
```bash
# Set up development environment
python quick_start.py

# Test all models comprehensively
python test_models.py

# Generate initial submissions
python src/main.py --model ensemble --output submission_v1.json
python src/main.py --model symbolic --output submission_v2.json
```

### Phase 2: Optimization (Weeks 3-4)
- Implement advanced transformation detection
- Add neural network components
- Optimize ensemble weights
- Prepare for open source release

### Phase 3: Competition (Weeks 5-6)
- Submit daily to track progress
- Iterate based on leaderboard feedback
- Prepare final submissions
- Ensure open source compliance

## üìä **Success Metrics**

### Short-term Goals
- [ ] **Beat 4.17% baseline** (Week 1)
- [ ] **Reach 10% performance** (Week 2)
- [ ] **Top 100 ranking** (Week 3)

### Medium-term Goals
- [ ] **Reach 15% performance** (Week 4)
- [ ] **Top 50 ranking** (Week 5)
- [ ] **Final submission ready** (Week 6)

### Long-term Goals
- [ ] **Reach 20% performance** (Competition)
